* __Alpha__

For alpha particles in air we can see process like:

2002: __ionization__: Particle or electromagnetic wave that carries enough energy to ionize or remove electrons from an atom.
2004: __pair production by charged particles__: a photon create an particle-antiparticle pair near a nucleus ( electron and a positron, a muon and an antimuon, or a proton and an antiproton)
2010: __multiple scattering__: Is the multiple scattering of charged particles in material.
2012: __photoelectric effect__: Is the emission of electrons or other free carriers when electromagnetic radiation, like light, hits a material.

We can see that the dominant processes are ionization and multiple scattering.

* __Beta__

For beta particles in air we can see process like:

2002: __ionization__
2003: __Bremsstrahlung__: When a particle passing near a nucleus dissipate energy in form of electromagnetic waves
2010: __multiple scattering__
2011: __Rayleigh scattering__: Elastic scattering of light or other electromagnetic radiation by particles much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation.
2012: __photoelectric effect__

We can see that the dominant process is ionization.

* __Gamma__

For gamma particles in air we can see process like:

2002: __ionization__
2010: __multiple scattering__
2011: __Rayleigh scattering__
2012: __photoelectric effect__
2013: __Compton scattering__: The collision between a photon and an electron. The photon bounces off a target electron and loses energy.
2014: __gamma conversion (pair production)__: Is a gamma ray that produce a pair of particles when it has a enough energy to produce them.

We can see that the dominant processes are ionization and multiple photoelectric effect.
